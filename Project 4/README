The objective of this project was to implement various functions for 
node based sets such as add, equals, remove, contain, union, intersection, 
and a few others. This project also explored differences in time complexity 
by implementing these methods for both LinkedSet and Set structures in which 
Sets do not have to maintain order among elements whereas LinkedSets do. 
An example of this difference in time complexity would be in the add method, 
where for Set structures you can implement this in constant time whereas 
LinkedSets require N time complexity. The hardest part of this project was 
the PowerSetIterator that we had to implement, which as the name implies, 
provides an iterator over the power set of a set. 
This was just a difficult conceptual challenge.
