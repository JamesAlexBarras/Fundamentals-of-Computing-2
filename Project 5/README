The prompt for this project was to create a word search game using the 
principles of recursive depth first search. Given a 2d array of characters, 
the "player" inputs words that they believe to be on the array and then an 
algorithm checks to see if this word is on the board via recursive depth 
first search. The algorithm searches for a starting point, then retrieves 
the neighboring characters and determine if they are a part of the called 
word by using said word as a blueprint, if the character fits then it 
retrieves the neighbors of it and keeps going until the word is constructed,
if a dead end is reached the algorithm recursively backtracks through the 
board until it finds another possible path. The was definitely a hard project 
as it was my first time using this type of searching and there were a lot of 
other things I had never done before such as using a 
2d array as a "board" and keeping up with visited positions on it.
