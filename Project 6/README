The prompt of this project was to implement various methods for a word 
ladder game. A word ladder is a sequence of words where you can get from 
the first word to the last through a sequence of words where each subsequent 
word has one changed letter from the previous wordÂ (EX. [cat, cot, dot, dog]). 
The core of this project was to implement this game using the principles of 
breadth first search. The main things I learned from this project were the 
principles behind breadth first search, how to implement breadth first search,
how to define and implement a method for retrieving "neighbors", and how to 
effectively use queues. Given what I learned from this project, 
I feel confident that I could implement this search pattern for any purpose
