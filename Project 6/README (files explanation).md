The purpose of each file is as follows:

"Doublets.java" : This is the file containing all of the methods for implementation of the project based on the "WordLadderGame.java" file

"WordLadderGame.java" : This is essentially an abstract file which told us the desired functionality of each method we needed to implement for the project

"DoubletsTest.java" : This is a test file used specifically to test the main 'getMinLadder' method

"ExampleClient.java" : This is a test file which tests all of the essential methods implemented in the "Doublets.java". This is the file I would recommend using for seeing the result of the search
