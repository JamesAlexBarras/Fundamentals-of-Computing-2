The goal of this project was to implement an autocomplete function similar 
to a google search bar's. So that, given a prefix you could output the most 
likely lines to follow that prefix (EX. if a person types "what to feed my ", 
googleÂ would print a list of the most likely complete versions of that string).
This program is that sophisticated though because it takes in a list of 
terms with set weights, thus allowing us to determine those most likely 
to follow a prefix. In this project we implemented our own comparators 
based on weight and prefix order. We also implemented binary search 
methods that search a lexicon for the index of the first term to have 
a given prefix, and the index of the last term to have a given prefix.
The hardest part of this project was implementing the comparators because 
they can be a little hard to understand conceptually when you're trying to 
define what you want less than, greater than, and equal to mean.
