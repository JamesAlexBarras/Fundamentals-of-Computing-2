The purpose of this project was to explore generality when pertaining to 
variable types. So, we implemented a slew of methods such as min, max, 
range, ceiling, etc by using a given comparator that compareÂ general 
objects of type <T>. Overall, this project was fairly easy. The most 
difficult part was understanding the concept of general variables.
